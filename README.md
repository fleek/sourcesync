## How to use it

Remote connection configurations can be added in the combo box placed in the **Navigation bar** at the right of **Run/Debug Configuration** combo box.

### Create Sourcesync remote connection configurations

1. With the Navigation bar visible (**View | Appearance | Navigation Bar**), choose **Edit Sourcesync Configurations** from the remote connection configuration selector or press
  `Ctrl + Shift + D`.
   ![Navigation Bar --> Edit Sourcesync Configurations](https://raw.github.com/fioan89//sourcesync/master/src/main/resources/sourcesync/edit_remote_configurations_combo_box.png)
2. In the *Sourcesync Remote Configurations* dialog, click the **Add** icon (+) on the toolbar or press `Alt + Insert`
   ![Add / Remove connections](https://raw.github.com/fioan89/sourcesync/master/src/main/resources/sourcesync/new_connection.png)
3. Input a remote connection name and the protocol to use
4. Close the dialog and edit the connection details, hit *Apply* in order to save the configurations and then *OK* to exit the window.  

### Select the remote configuration

The remote configurations created in the previous step will be available for all projects. But **Sourcesync** needs a single connection
to be associated with a project:
1. With the Navigation bar visible (**View | Appearance | Navigation Bar**), click the drop-down icon in the **Sourcesync Configurations** combo box.
2. Select one configuration listed under `Sourcesync Configurations` section.

## Passwordless SSH

The plugin support passwordless SSH for both **SFTP** and **SCP** connections. In order to take full advantage of this feature you are advised to create a pair of public/private keys on your local machine - where IntelliJ or PyCharm IDE resides. Then copy the public key on every remote host you will connect to:
Eg:```scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub my_user_id@remote_hostname_or_IP:~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub```
After this step is done, you should open a ssh shell to the remote machine where you will be prompted to authorize the key. Next you should open the **config window** and create a new **SFTP** connection. Then just like in the bellow picture, select **Use SSH key** and then browse and select the generated private key.

Also don't forget to set the username to connect on the remote machine.

## A few notes

**Sync this file to remote target** is only present on opened file and it will sync just that file to the remote machine.  

**Sync changed files to remote target** will upload version tracked files that are changed but not yet committed.  

**Sync selected files to remote target** this one is pretty straight forward. It will upload just the selected files.  

* If **SCP** protocol is used, please take note that this type of connection can only sync the file, it cannot create the entire directory tree where the file will be saved. Thus you need to have the tree created. This is not a bug of sourcesync. SCP is not a file protocol like **FTP**. It's only purpose is to transfer files.  
* For **FTP** and **FTPS** preserving timestamp is not yet supported. This is a work in progress.

## Tested on

* Windows 7
* GNU/Linux based OS's
* OS X 10.11
